# VH3-Ext-Scripts
Adds some additional crafttweaker scripts to Vault Hunters 3 to adjust some of the clutter in recipes and in JEI. This repository is intended to not change the balance of the pack in any shape or form by changing recipes, adding items, etc but to streamline some of the experience by removing overwhelming clutter for end users that may not be familiar with the majority of the mods. These scripts also include additional text additions on mod items to help clarify common questions on how some blocks/items work.

# Install
Download the scripts file you're interested in using (see below for details) and place in the scripts directory for Vault Hunters 3.

# Uninstall
Simply delete the file from the scripts directory. No other steps necessary for removal.
